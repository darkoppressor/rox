# rox
Smash rocks back and forth, and try to be the last stone standing!

I developed Rox to test my newly completed game engine, the Cheese Engine.
It’s a singleplayer and networked multiplayer game in which two players smash rocks back and forth, and try to score on one another.
It’s kind of like Pong but with a twist.
